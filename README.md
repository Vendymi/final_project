Me and my partner in crime - Diana were supposted as our final project create a program whitch finds the biggest square on a given map (map is determined by blank spaces and obsticles) and fills the biggest square with a filling character. This is our not the best looking solution as we ran out of time but it is still a solution we are proud of. Please injoy :))
