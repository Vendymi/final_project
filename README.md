Me and my partner in crime - Diana were supposted as our final project create a program which finds the biggest square on a given map (map is determined by blank characters and obsticles) and fills the biggest square with a filling character. This is our not-the-best-looking solution as we ran out of time but it is still a solution we are proud of. Please enjoy :))
